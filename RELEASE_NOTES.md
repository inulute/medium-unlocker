# Release v1.2

## 🚀 New Features

### Mirror Server Support
- Added support for `freedium-mirror.cfd` as a robust alternative to the primary server.
- **Default Behavior**: The app now defaults to the mirror server to ensure maximum availability for all users.

### Smart Auto-Retry
- **Seamless Switching**: If a connection fails (e.g., due to DNS blocking), the app automatically detects the issue and switches to the working server.
